# **WHAT I LEARNED IN  WEEK 0** 

## `The Terminal` 

**The terminal is a way of getting your computer to do what you want by using the command line. It is an efficient way of instructing files and directories to move, change, delete, add, copy and so on.**

Here are some key features that are worth mentioning:

#### `ls (Lists files in the current directory)`




#### `ls -a (Lists files in the current directory with hidden files)`



#### `cd (Changes directory)` 



#### `pwd (Tells you where you are)`




#### `touch (add files to current directory)`



#### `mkdir (Makes a directory or directories)`



#### `touch (Makes a file or files)`


#### `rm (Removes files)`


#### `cp (copies chosen file(s) to chosen place)`

#### `mv (moves chosen file(s) to chosen place )`
