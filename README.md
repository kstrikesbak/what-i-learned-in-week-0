# **WHAT I LEARNED IN  WEEK 0** 

## `The Terminal` 

**The terminal is a way of getting your computer to do what you want by using the command line. It is an efficient way of instructing files and directories to move, change, delete, add, copy and so on.**

Here are some key features that are worth mentioning:

#### `ls (Lists files in the current directory)`



#### `ls -a (Lists files in the current directory with hidden files)`



#### `cd (Changes directory)` 



#### `pwd (Tells you where you are)`




#### `touch (add files to current directory)`



#### `mkdir (Makes a directory or directories)`



#### `touch (Makes a file or files)`


#### `rm (Removes files)`


#### `cp (copies chosen file(s) to chosen place)`

#### `mv (moves chosen file(s) to chosen place )`

## `HOW I SEND THIS FILE TO GITHUB` 

1) I made a directory called what-i-learned-in-week-0 (`mkdir what-i-learned-in-week-0` )
2) I changed to the directory "what-i-learned-in-week-0" (`cd what-i-learned-in-week-0`)
3) Create a README.md file in the directory (`touch README.md`) 
4) Open the README.md file in Visual Studio Code (`code README.md`)
5) Use the command `git init` to convert the README.md file into an invisible git file 
6) Then I let git know about the file I intend to commit by using the command `git add README.md`
7) I then used the commit command `git commit -m "first commit"`. The m is a flag that stands for message. It is very important to use a message as it differentiates this commit to all future commits. 
8) Get the empty README file to Github using using the command `git remote add origin https://github.com/kstrikesbak/what-i-learned-in-week-0.git`
9) Then tell git hub where to send the what-learned-in-week-0 repo by using the command `git push -u origin master`

## `MARKDOWN` 

Markdown is a simple text to HTML conversion tool. It is designed to make your life a little bit easier. Markdown is very intuitive because the markdown characters look like the formatted results. Markdown also makes text much easier to read. 

For example, `# Markdown is great` would equate to `<h1>Markdown is great</h1>` . It goes up to `#6` which is compliments the smallest heading of `<h6>Hi!</h6>` that HTML offers!

The simplicity is great! There are many other features that make markdown a great alternative for emails, presentations and so on..
